== Description ==
Adds a page peel in the corner of the site... with jQuery! no Flash :D
Based on the work by Soh Tanaka: http://www.sohtanaka.com/web-design/simple-page-peel-effect-with-jquery-css/
If your theme's stylesheet modifies the body's width, 
PageCornr will look bad. Use a Wrapper and modify the width from it. 
In that way, PageCornr will stay in the corner.

== Installation ==
